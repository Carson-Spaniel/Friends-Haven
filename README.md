# Rate It Social Platform

This project is a social media platform called "Rate It." It is a platform where users can create posts to speak their mind about anything they choose where they can upload into many different topics. The topics include: Recipes, TV Shows, Movies, Books, and Music. 

## Project Notes

I created this platform for mobile devices and not a web version. Most of my previous projects have been websites, but I wanted to eventually turn this into an app thats why I was focused on smaller screens. The main reason of this project was to gain more experience with something that is more complex than anything I've done before. There are a lot of functionalities that the platform features that I had a lot of fun making. A full site plan can be found in the project files.

## Features

- **Login/Sign Up:** Users create an account in order to user the platform. Signing up is very easy and takes no time at all.
- **Posting:** When creating a post, you first need to specify which category to post into. After that you can upload any picture you want. You also need to provide a rating, name for the item, caption, description, and anything else that falls under a specific category.
- **Following:** Users can also follow their favorite idols in order to keep up with their posts on the home page.
- **Profile:** Users can customize their profile by being able to change the profile picture and description. They can also see how many rates they have made, idols they are following, and how many fans they have.
- **Wander Page:** A place where users can search up other users, or filter all posts to only see specific topics.

- **Edit/delete Posts:**Even after you have created your post you can go back and edit some parts of the post. You can also delete the post.

## Future Development

Future updates to the platform will include styling the entire platform to better increase user experience and make it more appealing. I also want to convert this website to an app. Doing this will give me a great experience playing with APIs.

## Usage

1. In the main project folder, run `py manage.py runserver` in order to start the site.
2. Optionally, you can run the server off your wifi so that you can play with the platform on your phone by running `py manage.py runserver {ip address}:8000`.
